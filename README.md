# JAVA-INTERVIEW-QUESTIONS

Explain what Java Spring Boot is.
Java Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework designed to simplify the development of Spring-based applications. It helps developers create stand-alone, production-ready applications with minimal configuration by providing defaults for many configurations.

# Name five Java Spring Boot features.

Auto-configuration
Starter dependencies
Embedded servers (like Tomcat)
Spring Boot CLI
Actuator for monitoring and managing applications

# Name four advantages of using Java Spring Boot.

Rapid development: Minimal setup with auto-configuration.
Microservice-ready: Ideal for building microservices.
Embedded servers: No need for external servers.
Production-ready features: Actuator, metrics, and monitoring tools built-in.

# Outline four critical Java Spring Boot components.
@SpringBootApplication annotation
Spring Boot Starters
Spring Boot Actuator
Spring Boot DevTools

# Which skills do you need to use Java Spring Boot?
Java programming
Understanding of Spring framework
REST API development
Maven/Gradle knowledge
Basic knowledge of cloud platforms and microservices architecture

# Which soft skills do you think are needed to use Java Spring Boot?
Problem-solving skills
Collaboration and teamwork
Attention to detail
Ability to learn new technologies

# What are you doing to improve your skills?
Continuous learning through online courses, building personal projects, and contributing to open-source projects.

# Explain what makes Java Spring Boot different from Spring.
Spring Boot provides an opinionated framework with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and predefined defaults to simplify Spring development, while Spring requires manual configuration of beans and setup.

# Explain how Java Spring Boot works.
Spring Boot works by utilizing auto-configuration to automatically configure Spring components based on the project dependencies and settings. It also allows for embedded servers to run applications directly without the need for external servers.

# Explain what the annotation @SpringBootApplication does.
@SpringBootApplication is a combination of three annotations:

@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
@Configuration
It simplifies the bootstrapping of a Spring application.

# Explain what the @ComponentScan annotation does and how to use it.
@ComponentScan tells Spring to scan the specified package(s) for beans and components, allowing Spring to detect classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Controller, and others. It can be customized with a base package to scan.

# Explain how to start a Java Spring Boot application.
A Spring Boot application can be started by running the main() method in the class annotated with @SpringBootApplication. Alternatively, it can be started via the Spring Boot CLI or Maven/Gradle commands.

# Explain what starter dependencies are.
Starter dependencies in Spring Boot provide a convenient way to include common libraries and dependencies into your project. For example, spring-boot-starter-web brings in the necessary dependencies for building web applications.

# Explain what the Spring initializer is.
Spring Initializer is an online tool that generates a pre-configured Spring Boot project with the selected dependencies and project structure, making it easier to start a new Spring Boot application.

# Explain what the Java Spring Boot CLI is.
Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows developers to run Spring applications without needing to write a full application setup by using Groovy scripts and auto-configuring necessary components.

# Name one key advantage of using the Java Spring Boot CLI.
Rapid prototyping: You can write and run Spring Boot applications with minimal code using Groovy, without needing to set up an entire project.

# Name seven frequently-used Java Spring Boot CLI commands.

spring run
spring init
spring install
spring uninstall
spring version
spring help
spring jar

# What are the various phases of the RAD model?

Requirements planning
User design
Construction
Cutover

# Explain what the RAD model is.
The RAD (Rapid Application Development) model emphasizes quick development and iterative user feedback, allowing for rapid prototyping and adjustments throughout the development process.

# Explain what DevTools does in Spring Boot.
Spring Boot DevTools enhances the development experience by enabling features such as automatic application restarts, live reload, and faster feedback loops during development.

# Explain what spring-boot-starter-parent is.
spring-boot-starter-parent is a special Maven POM that manages dependency versions and configurations for a Spring Boot application, reducing the need for manual dependency management. It inherits default configurations, including plugin versions and dependency management, making it easier to maintain.
